# aphro

Road trip. People you don't know well. Only one speaker system to play music on. Hour 1, you're wincing listening to the driver's heavy metal. Hour 2, you're silently nodding off through the girl in the passenger seat's k-pop playlist. By hour 5, maybe you've finally found a song that everyone in the car can fuck with.

Aphro was built to give you a playlist you can compromise on by minute 1. No more sitting through bands you've never heard of from Sweden, or hard Spanish rap that only one person out of four can understand.

We take everyone's playlists and saved songs, and create a curated playlist of common songs and artists that you're all more likely to agree on.
